## ✨ Key Features

* **🔴 Movement Visualizer:** A unique "Red Dot" graph that visualizes your mouse movement direction, speed, and stops.
* **⏳ Visual Persistence:** Keys and clicks stay visible for a few seconds after you release them (so your viewers don't miss anything).
* **⚙️ Settings Launcher:** A built-in configuration window lets you change colors, speed, and sensitivity before you start—no coding required!
* **📌 Always On Top:** The overlay stays floating above your game, browser, or creative software.
* **🎨 Fully Customizable:** Change the dot color, sensitivity, and timing to match your stream branding.
* **🚀 Portable:** Runs as a single `.exe` file. No installation needed.
